# Porfolia2

An rewritten repo for [nahueld/porfolia](https://github.com/nahueld/portfolia).
Porfolia is a great repo to study mobx. But since now mobx has update to v6, it's a bit outdate of the project use. so I rewrite the original repo and try hard to stduy the best pratice of typescript + react + mobx.

## goals

- [x] update to react 17, mobx 6
- [x] rewrite in typescript
- [x] mobx-react -> mobx-react-lite
- [ ] best pratice of react hooks
